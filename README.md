## Overview

The Disaster Management App is an Android application designed to provide users with real-time information about natural disasters and quick access to emergency contacts. Leveraging data from the NASA EONET API, the app displays a categorized list of recent natural events, including droughts, landslides, and snow events. Users can browse these events, view their details, and stay informed about ongoing situations.
